    "\n",
    "* **Neural Networks** are a computational approach based on a large collection of neural units, which seeks to model the way a biological brain solves certain problems with large clusters of biological neurons connected by axons. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements - or neurones - working in unison to solve specific problems. **Neural Networks**, like people, learn by example and are configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"intro.PNG\" style=\"width: 500px;\"  />\n",

    "* In machine learning, the **perceptron** is an algorithm for supervised learning involving binary classifiers, in which the functions decide whether an input belongs to a specific class or not.\n",

    "<img src=\"perceptron.PNG\" style=\"width: 500px;\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function $\\mathbb{f}=\\mathbb{R}^m$ -> $\\mathbb{R}^o$ by training on a dataset, where **_m_** is the number of dimensions for input and **_o_** is the number of dimensions for output.\n",
    "Based on a set of neurons in the leftmost layer which represents the input features, the values in the previous layer are transformed in the hidden layers by each neuron and its associated weight . The weighted linear summation is represented as _w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wmxm_. This is followed by a non-linear activation function . The output layer receives the values from the last hidden layer and transforms them into output values.\n",

    "Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) can be used for classifying people's faces from images, and it does this by performing recognition of face characteristics. The human face has about 80 different characteristic parameters, and some of them are: \n",
    "1. Distance between middles of the eyes\n",
    "2. Distance between middle of the left eyes and middle point of mouth\n",
    "3. Distance between middle of the right eyes and middle point of mouth\n",

    "7. Distance of middle point of J1 and middle of nose\n",
    "8. Width of nose\n",
    "\n",
    "Face characteristics are made of these parameters and then inserted in a database. Then a MLP classifier is used to adjust to the network's weights and thresholds to minimize the error in its predictions on the training set. If the model is properly constructed, it can subsequently be used to make predictions where the output is unknown, such as recognizing which face in a picture belongs to a particular person.\n",

    "\n",
    "MLP networks, with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data, can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques. A trained neural network can be thought of as an \"expert\" in the category of information it has been given to analyze. This expert can then be used to provide projections given new situations of interest and answer \"what if\" questions. \n",
    "What sets apart MLP networks is their capability of generalization, that is, they classify an unknown pattern with other known patterns that share the same distinguishing features. This means noisy or incomplete inputs will be classified because of their similarity with pure and complete inputs. They are also highly fault tolerant. This characteristic is also known as \"graceful degradation\".  Because of its distributed nature, a neural network keeps on working even when a significant fraction of its neurons and interconnections fail. Also, relearning after damage can be relatively quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, MLP is a computationally expensive learning process. Large number of iterations are required for learning so it’s not suitable for real-time learning. Moreover, there is no guaranteed solution. It will perform better on some kinds of problems while not so good on others. It is a black box learning approach, so it cannot interpret relationships between the input and output variables and cannot deal with uncertainties. So, how the MLP performs is situation dependent in the sense that the user should have a fair idea which problems he/she should use the MLP classifier for. For instance, an MLP classifier would be best suited for speech synthesis or pattern recognition.\n",
